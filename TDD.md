# TDD evidence

## v1 pairing

- Red: `mix test test/relay_protocol_test.exs` failed with `WebSockex.RequestError{code: 404}` because the bootstrap router had no `/ws` upgrade route.
- Green: the same real Bandit/WebSocket test passed after adding query validation, the WebSock upgrade, and the single-node session registry.

## v2 control and buffering

- Red: the first control assertion failed because it compared serialized JSON rather than the control message it represents.
- Green: the test now decodes the real received control frame and verifies the `sync` and `connected` messages, then verifies ordered buffered text and binary delivery after the daemon data socket connects.

## duplicate daemon data

- Red: `mix test test/relay_protocol_test.exs:102` timed out waiting for the replacement daemon data socket after the displaced socket's termination deleted the new route.
- Green: the registry now deletes a v2 data route only when its current owner disconnects; the focused real-WebSocket test passes.

## distributed ownership and reroute

- Red: the real peer-node test exposed that tying ownership to the first request could move an otherwise active session when that request process exited.
- Green: a per-`serverId` owner now reserves upgrades, monitors every attached WebSocket, expires abandoned reservations, and remains authoritative until the whole session is idle. Real `:peer` tests cover concurrent claims, remote lookup, owner loss, and takeover.
- Red: the pre-upgrade router test reached WebSocket negotiation on a non-owner node.
- Green: the non-owner now returns the configured opaque reroute response before upgrade; the owner still completes a real Bandit WebSocket handshake.

## public identifier bounds

- Red: a 257-byte `serverId` completed a `101 Switching Protocols` response and claimed distributed ownership.
- Green: identifiers longer than 256 bytes now receive `400` before ownership, while empty client connection IDs retain the compatible generated-ID behavior.

## sharded load generation

- Red: a real black-box run requesting `--no-control` still opened five WebSockets for two pairs because every load process unconditionally opened its own daemon control socket.
- Green: sharded runs can omit that single shared socket and use an explicit connection-ID prefix. A real Bandit/WebSocket test verifies four data sockets, bidirectional frames, and clean shutdown without importing relay internals.
- Red: the same real-server test had no keepalive accounting when a keepalive interval was requested.
- Green: every open test socket can now send a small, separately-counted keepalive frame during long ramps; timers are cleared on close and finalization.
