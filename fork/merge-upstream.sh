# Merge the rebranded upstream into main. This is the unsafe half of the
# upstream sync — it stages a merge into the checked-out branch and leaves it
# uncommitted, so the caller decides whether the result builds before
# committing. fork/sync-upstream-rebrand.sh is the safe half: advancing and
# rebranding the upstream-rebrand branch, safe to run anytime.
#
# Two modes, exactly one required:
#
#   --release  merge upstream's newest release tag, beta or stable. First advances
#       upstream-rebrand to that tag (same mechanics as the sync script).
#       Release tags were green across every workflow; arbitrary main commits
#       fail CI about a quarter of the time, which is why automation merges
#       releases, not main. Bails out quietly (exit 0) when no new release
#       exists.
#
#   --main     merge upstream's current main as it stands right now, for
#       expediting upstream between releases. Checks that upstream-rebrand is
#       current first and runs the sync if it is not.
#
# Both modes exit 1 listing the conflicted files if the merge conflicts.
#
# Usage: fork/merge-upstream.sh --release | --main
