# Advance the standing upstream-rebrand branch to the tip of upstream's main
# and rebrand it. Safe to run anywhere at any time — daily by hand, from CI, or
# before a trial merge. Main is never touched.
#
# The fork renames Paseo to Rambla everywhere, so upstream's text and the
# fork's text disagree on almost every line that mentions the brand. Merging
# upstream directly means fighting that on every sync.
#
# upstream-rebrand is a standing branch holding upstream's tree with the rename
# applied. Because it is an ancestor of main, the merge base between them is
# always a rebranded commit, so the fork's side of a brand-only file matches
# that base and git simply takes upstream's change. Recreating this branch from
# scratch would put the merge base back on unrenamed upstream and every brand
# conflict would return. It must persist.
#
# Deleted upstream files come along: the whole tree is replaced, not merged.
# The merge into main lives in fork/merge-upstream.sh.
#
# The branch has two writers, this machine and the CI bot, and every advance is
# a new commit even for the same upstream tip. So each writer reconciles with
# origin before advancing and pushes straight after. Skipping either half is
# what silently forked the branch in September 2026 and put an unrebranded
# upstream commit back in the merge base.
#
# Usage: fork/sync-upstream-rebrand.sh [<upstream-ref>]   (default upstream/main)
